Instructor of record: Winter 2022, Spring 2021, Summer 2018.\nThis course applies insights from economic theory and real-world data to explore the causes of inequality in the labor market. Building upon concepts from introductory microeconomics, we will analyze the responses of workers and employers to changes in incentives, and consider the roles of policy, institutions, and other social phenomena in shaping labor market outcomes. As part of this line of inquiry, we will develop a toolkit that integrates theory and data, paying special attention to the ways in which we can identify—or fail to identify—causal relationships from data. Beyond refining their understanding of mechanisms that drive income inequality, successful students will leave the course with a framework for evaluating evidence and policy.\n Course materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Econometrics (EC 320), University of Oregon.  Instructor of record: Fall 2019, Summer 2019.\nThis course introduces the statistical techniques that help economists learn about the world using data. Using calculus and introductory statistics, students will cultivate a working understanding of the theory underpinning regression analysis—how it works, why it works, and when it can lead us astray. As the course progresses, students will apply the insights of theory to work with and learn from actual data using R, a statistical programming language. My goal is for students to leave the course with marketable skills in data analysis and—most importantly—a more sophisticated understanding of the notion that correlation does not necessarily imply causation.\n Course materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Microeconomics (EC 201), University of Oregon.  Instructor of record: Winter 2020, Winter 2019.  Teaching assistant: Spring 2019, Fall 2018, Spring 2018, Spring 2017.\nThe purpose of this course is to cultivate economic intuition. My goal is not to teach students what to think, but rather how to think as economists. The course considers how social outcomes are shaped by the decisions of many individuals, even though each individual commands only a small fraction of the economy. Expanding upon the notion that individuals respond to incentives, students will use models to analyze and assess a variety of social phenomena. Successful students will leave the course with an intellectual framework for understanding and evaluating economic issues and policy.\n Course materials"

    "text": "2024, “Does the Salience of Race Mitigate Gaps in Disciplinary Outcomes? Evidence from School Fights,” Economics of Education Review (with Glen Waddell).\n\n\n\n\nRacial gaps in the adjudication of student misconduct are well documented—relative to white students engaged in similar behaviors, students of color are more likely to be disciplined and the discipline they receive tends to be harsher. We show that racial disparities in the adjudication of fighting infractions depend on the racial composition of incidents. While significant disparities exist within schools, we find little if any within-incident disparities. Examining disparities across fights, we show that students of color are punished more severely, on average, as fights involving only students of color are punished more severely than fights involving only white students. Moreover, students of color in multi-race fights receive punishments that are statistically indistinguishable from those assigned to white students in fights involving only white students, suggesting that disparities arise from the differential adjudication of incidents by their racial composition rather than from the differential adjudication of students within the same incident.\n\n Manuscript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022, “Voting Rights and the Resilience of Black Turnout,” Economic Inquiry.\n\n\n\n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 increased turnout among Black voters, which then generated economic benefits for Black communities. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court invalidated the enforcement mechanism responsible for these improvements, prompting concerns that states with histories of discriminatory election practices would respond by suppressing Black turnout. I estimate the effect of the Shelby decision on the racial composition of the electorate using triple-difference comparisons of validated turnout data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. The data suggest that the Shelby decision did not widen the Black-white turnout gap in states subject to the ruling.\n\n Manuscript  Appendix  Code  CNN  The New York Times (1)  The New York Times (2)"
